PROBLEM STATEMENT
Fox Ciel is writing an AI for the game Starcraft and she needs your help.


In Starcraft, one of the available units is a mutalisk.
Mutalisks are very useful for harassing Terran bases.
Fox Ciel has one mutalisk.
The enemy base contains one or more Space Construction Vehicles (SCVs).
Each SCV has some amount of hit points.


When the mutalisk attacks, it can target up to three different SCVs.

The first targeted SCV will lose 9 hit points.
The second targeted SCV (if any) will lose 3 hit points.
The third targeted SCV (if any) will lose 1 hit point.

If the hit points of a SCV drop to 0 or lower, the SCV is destroyed.
Note that you may not target the same SCV twice in the same attack.


You are given a vector <int> HP containing the current hit points of your enemy's SCVs.
Return the smallest number of attacks in which you can destroy all these SCVs.
