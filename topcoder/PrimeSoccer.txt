PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are watching a soccer match, and you wonder what the probability is that at least one of the two teams will score a prime number of goals.  The game lasts 90 minutes, and to simplify the analysis, we will split the match into five-minute intervals.  The first interval is the first five minutes, the second interval is the next five minutes, and so on.  During each interval, there is a skillOfTeamA percent probability that team A will score a goal, and a skillOfTeamB percent probability that teamB will score a goal.  Assume that each team will score at most one goal within each interval.  Return the probability that at least one team will have a prime number as its final score.

DEFINITION
Class:PrimeSoccer
Method:getProbability
Parameters:int, int
Returns:double
Method signature:double getProbability(int skillOfTeamA, int skillOfTeamB)


NOTES
-The returned value must be accurate to within a relative or absolute value of 1E-9.
-A prime number is a number that has exactly two divisors, 1 and itself. Note that 0 and 1 are not prime.


CONSTRAINTS
-skillOfTeamA will be between 0 and 100, inclusive.
-skillOfTeamB will be between 0 and 100, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
50
50

Returns: 0.5265618908306351



1)
100
100

Returns: 0.0

Both teams will score a goal in each interval, so the final result will be 18 to 18.

2)
12
89

Returns: 0.6772047168840167
